# Unified Chess Game Architecture - Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Migrate to a unified architecture where both online and offline games use the same core components, with the online game's realtime approach as the foundation.

**Strategy**: Phased migration with the local game kept as reference until all features are migrated.

**Timeline**: 4 phases, incrementally building features while maintaining stability.

### The Core Principle: Separation of Concerns

**Game ≠ Opponent**

This refactoring is fundamentally about separating two distinct responsibilities:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         GAME COMPONENT          │
│                                 │
│  Owns EVERYTHING about the game:│
│  • Chess rules (chess.js)       │
│  • Board state                  │
│  • Sound effects                │
│  • UI rendering                 │
│  • Move validation              │
│  • Game end detection           │
│  • Captured pieces              │
│  • Move history                 │
│  • Timers                       │
└────────────┬────────────────────┘
             │
             │ uses
             │
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      OPPONENT ABSTRACTION       │
│                                 │
│  ONLY handles communication:    │
│  • sendMove(from, to)           │
│  • onOpponentMove(callback)     │
│  • That's it!                   │
│                                 │
│  NO game logic                  │
│  NO board state                 │
│  NO validation                  │
│  NO sounds                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Matters:**

Before this refactoring, responsibilities were confused:
- ❌ Opponent was handling game state
- ❌ Opponent was triggering sounds
- ❌ Opponent was managing game completion
- ❌ Game logic was spread across game and opponent

After this refactoring, responsibilities are clear:
- ✅ Game owns ALL game logic
- ✅ Opponent ONLY passes messages
- ✅ Clean separation = easier to reason about
- ✅ Either opponent type (online/bot/friend) works the same way

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Online Game (Target Architecture)
**File**: `src/components/OnlineGame.tsx`

**Purpose**: Human vs Human over the network

#### ✅ What It Has:
- **Realtime sync** via Supabase channels
- **Optimistic updates** for responsive UX
- **Server validation** with rollback on rejection
- **Better piece selection UX** (click to deselect, switch pieces)
- **chess.js library** for rules (industry standard)
- **Timer management** with timeout handling
- **Forfeit functionality**

#### ❌ Needs to Add:
- ❌ Drag and drop pieces
- ❌ Promotion modal (currently hardcoded to queen)
- ❌ Checkmate sound (currently plays check sound)
- ❌ Better stalemate handling

#### 🚫 Intentionally Excluded (by design):
- 🚫 Undo moves - Can't undo opponent's moves
- 🚫 Hints - Unfair competitive advantage
- 🚫 Game reset - Games persist in database
- 🚫 Game mode selection - Mode is "online multiplayer"
- 🚫 Bot/AI opponent - Uses human opponents

---

### Offline Game (Reference Implementation)
**Files**: `src/hooks/useMoveRules.ts`, `src/hooks/useGameBoard.ts`, `src/hooks/useComputerAI.ts`

**Purpose**: Human vs Bot or Human vs Human (local)

#### ✅ What It Has:
- **Drag and drop** fully implemented
- **Undo moves** with full game state reconstruction
- **Hints system** (unlimited, shows best moves)
- **Game reset** with mode selection
- **Promotion modal** (choose piece type)
- **Bot AI** with difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- **Game mode** (vs Friend, vs Bot)
- **Complete game state management** (en passant, castling, etc.)
- **Checkmate sound** properly plays

#### ❌ Needs to Add:
- ❌ Better piece selection UX (from online game)

#### 🚫 Intentionally Excluded (by design):
- 🚫 Network/online features - Local only
- 🚫 Forfeit - Can just reset the game

---

## Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Online | Offline | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| Click to move | ✅ Advanced | ✅ Basic | - | Online has better UX |
| Drag and drop | ❌ | ✅ | **P0** | Needed for offline |
| Valid move highlights | ✅ | ✅ | - | Both have |
| Undo moves | N/A | ✅ | **P1** | **Offline only** - Can't undo opponent |
| Hints | N/A | ✅ | **P1** | **Offline only** - Would be unfair online |
| Game reset | ❌ | ✅ | **P2** | Needed for offline |
| Promotion modal | ❌ | ✅ | **P0** | Both need this |
| Sound effects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Unified |
| Move history | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Both have |
| Captured pieces | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Both have |
| Timers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Both have |
| Bot AI | N/A | ✅ | **P0** | **Offline only** - Local opponent |
| Online multiplayer | ✅ | N/A | ✅ Done | **Online only** - Network opponent |
| Forfeit | ✅ | N/A | ✅ Done | **Online only** - Can just reset offline |
| Checkmate sound | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ | **P2** | Polish |
| Stalemate detection | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ | **P2** | Polish |

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Feature exists
- ❌ = Feature missing (needs to be added)
- **N/A** = Feature not applicable to this mode (by design)
- ⚠️ = Feature partially implemented

---

## Phased Migration Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current State)
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- [x] Sound effects unified via `useChessSounds` hook
- [x] Both games working independently
- [x] Online game has better piece selection UX

---

### Phase 1: Create Abstraction Layer ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Build the opponent abstraction focused ONLY on communication

**Duration**: Completed

**Key Learning**: Opponent should NOT handle game logic - only message passing!

#### What We Built:

1. **`types/gameOpponent.ts`** - Super simple interface
   ```typescript
   interface OpponentMove {
     from: string        // Just "e2"
     to: string          // Just "e4"
     promotion?: string  // Just "q"
     // NO FEN, NO board state, NO game data!
   }

   interface GameOpponent {
     // Send my move to opponent
     sendMove: (move: OpponentMove) => Promise<void>

     // Listen for opponent's move
     onOpponentMove: (callback: (move: OpponentMove) => void) => () => void

     // Cleanup
     disconnect: () => void

     // UI flag (show forfeit vs undo/hints)
     isOnline: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **`hooks/useSupabaseOpponent.ts`** - Online communication
   - Sends move to server via `makeMove()`
   - Broadcasts move via realtime channel
   - Receives opponent's move from channel
   - **Does NOT**: Validate, update board, play sounds, manage game state

3. **`hooks/useLocalOpponent.ts`** - Local communication
   - Bot mode: Triggers AI calculation (easy/medium/hard)
   - Friend mode: No-op (both players local)
   - Artificial delay (200-500ms) for natural feel
   - **Does NOT**: Apply moves, validate, update board, play sounds

**Key Principle Established**:
```
Game Component:
├── Owns: Rules, board, sounds, UI, validation, timers
└── Uses: opponent.sendMove() and opponent.onOpponentMove()

Opponent Hook:
├── Owns: Message passing ONLY
└── Does NOT: Touch game state, sounds, validation, board
```

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Clean `GameOpponent` interface (communication only)
- ✅ `useSupabaseOpponent` (thin wrapper around existing Supabase calls)
- ✅ `useLocalOpponent` (bot AI + artificial delay)
- ✅ Zero existing code modified
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

---

### Phase 2: Unified Game Component (Core Features) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create new unified game component with essential features

**Duration**: Completed

**Status**: ChessGame component fully functional with all handlers

#### Completed Tasks:

1. ✅ **Created `components/ChessGame.tsx`**

- ✅ Ready for testing with real opponent implementations

**Next**: Need to test with actual opponent instances (online, bot, friend)

---

### Phase 2.5: Integration & Testing (CURRENT PHASE)
**Goal**: Test ChessGame component with real opponent implementations and fix issues

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

**Status**: IN PROGRESS

#### Critical Issue Identified: Timer Synchronization

The online game ([OnlineGame.tsx:65-140](src/components/OnlineGame.tsx#L65-L140)) has **server-synchronized timer logic**:
- Timers count down based on `game.current_turn` from database
- When time runs out, updates game status in database
- Declares winner on timeout
- Syncs with server state

**ChessGame currently has**: Local timers only (not synced with server)

#### Tasks:

1. **Add Timer Sync for Online Mode** (PRIORITY)
   - [ ] Extract timer logic from OnlineGame.tsx
   - [ ] Add timer sync to useSupabaseOpponent OR ChessGame
   - [ ] Handle timeout -> database update -> winner declaration
   - [ ] Keep local timers for offline mode
   - [ ] Conditional timer behavior based on opponent.isOnline

2. **Create Test/Demo Page**
   - [ ] Create `pages/TestGame.tsx` or update existing route
   - [ ] Add opponent type selector (bot/friend/online)
   - [ ] Instantiate ChessGame with selected opponent
   - [ ] Add debug UI to inspect game state

3. **Test Offline Modes First**
   - [ ] Test with useLocalOpponent (bot - easy/medium/hard)
   - [ ] Test with useLocalOpponent (friend mode)
   - [ ] Verify: moves, drag-and-drop, undo, hints, reset
   - [ ] Verify: sound effects, captured pieces, move history
   - [ ] Verify: bot AI triggers correctly with artificial delay

4. **Test Online Mode**
   - [ ] Test with useSupabaseOpponent
   - [ ] Verify: move sync via realtime
   - [ ] Verify: timer sync with database
   - [ ] Verify: forfeit functionality
   - [ ] Test edge cases: disconnection, timeout, checkmate

5. **Fix Issues Found**
   - [ ] Document any bugs or missing features
   - [ ] Fix critical issues blocking usage
   - [ ] Defer non-critical issues to Phase 3

**Key Decisions to Make**:
- **Where to handle timer sync?**
  - Option A: Inside ChessGame (add useEffect for online mode)
  - Option B: Inside useSupabaseOpponent (return timer state)
  - Option C: Create separate useOnlineTimer hook

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Timer sync working for online mode
- [ ] Test page/route functional
- [ ] All three opponent types tested
- [ ] Critical bugs fixed
- [ ] List of remaining polish items for Phase 3

---

### Phase 3: Polish & Advanced Features (P1)
**Goal**: Polish existing features and handle edge cases

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Status**: PENDING

#### Tasks:

1. **Polish Undo/Hints** (already implemented, just verify)
   - [ ] Ensure undo reconstructs state correctly
   - [ ] Improve hint visualization (already shows gold squares)
   - [ ] Add hint limit or unlimited mode

2. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - [ ] En passant edge cases
   - [ ] Castling edge cases
   - [ ] Promotion edge cases
   - [ ] Threefold repetition detection (chess.js has it)
   - [ ] Insufficient material detection (chess.js has it)

3. **Improve Online Experience**
   - [ ] Add "waiting for opponent" indicator
   - [ ] Show opponent's last move clearly
   - [ ] Add move confirmation (optional)

4. **Bot AI Improvements**
   - [ ] Verify bot difficulty levels work correctly
   - [ ] Add bot "thinking" indicator
   - [ ] Tune artificial delay (currently 200-500ms)

5. **Game Mode Selection** (if needed)
   - [ ] Modal at game start for offline games
   - [ ] Choose: vs Friend, vs Easy Bot, vs Medium Bot, vs Hard Bot
   - [ ] Or keep current approach (route-based selection)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] All edge cases handled
- [ ] Bot AI working smoothly
- [ ] Online experience polished
- [ ] Ready for migration

---

### Phase 4: Migration & Cleanup (FINAL)
**Goal**: Replace old components, remove duplicate code, finalize migration

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Status**: PENDING

#### Tasks:

1. **Route Migration**:
   - [ ] Update `/game` route to use ChessGame instead of current components
   - [ ] Update lobby to work with new component
   - [ ] Ensure all game creation flows work
   - [ ] Test navigation between pages

2. **Remove Old Code**:
   - [ ] Remove or deprecate `OnlineGame.tsx` (after online mode works)
   - [ ] Remove or deprecate `useMoveRules.ts` (after offline modes work)
   - [ ] Remove `useGameBoard.ts` if no longer needed
   - [ ] Keep utility functions in `utils/chess.ts`
   - [ ] Keep `useComputerAI.ts` (wrapped by useLocalOpponent)

3. **Final Testing**:
   - [ ] End-to-end test: Create lobby → Join game → Play online
   - [ ] End-to-end test: Local game → Bot AI at all difficulties
   - [ ] End-to-end test: Local game → Friend mode
   - [ ] Test all edge cases: checkmate, stalemate, timeout, forfeit
   - [ ] Test all special moves: castling, en passant, promotion

4. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Update README with new architecture diagram
   - [ ] Document GameOpponent interface usage
   - [ ] Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - [ ] Update component documentation

5. **Performance & Polish**:
   - [ ] Check for unnecessary re-renders
   - [ ] Optimize bot AI if needed
   - [ ] Final UX polish
   - [ ] Add loading states where needed

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Old code removed/deprecated
- [ ] All routes using ChessGame
- [ ] End-to-end testing complete
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Migration complete! 🎉

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Keep chess.js for Online Games?
- Industry-standard library
- Server-side validation already uses it
- More reliable than custom implementation
- Online games need server trust anyway

### 2. Why Add Artificial Latency to Local Games?
- Consistent UX between online and offline
- Prevents jarring instant bot moves
- Makes animations and sounds feel natural
- Configurable (can be disabled for debugging)

### 3. Why Are Undo/Hints/Bot AI Offline-Only?

**These features are NOT applicable to online games by design:**

**Undo:**
- You can't undo your opponent's moves
- Online games are competitive - no take-backs
- Could add "takeback request" feature later (mutual agreement)
- Offline games allow undo because you control both sides

**Hints:**
- Would be unfair advantage in competitive online play
- Like having a coach whispering moves during a tournament
- Offline games allow hints for learning/practice

**Bot AI:**
- Online games have human opponents via network
- Bot AI is the "opponent" for offline games
- Two completely different opponent types (network vs local)
- This is the core reason for the `GameOpponent` abstraction!

### 4. How to Handle Different Timer Behaviors?
- Online: Server-synced timers (authoritative)
- Offline: Local timers (no sync needed)
- Both use same `Timer` component
- Opponent interface abstracts the difference

### 5. Do We Need Backend/Service Changes?

**NO! This is a frontend-only refactoring.**

**What stays the same:**
- ✅ Database schema (games, moves, profiles tables)
- ✅ `validate-move` edge function
- ✅ Supabase Realtime channels
- ✅ Authentication & RLS policies
- ✅ All API contracts

**Why no backend changes needed:**
- The `GameOpponent` interface is a **thin wrapper** around existing Supabase calls
- `useSupabaseOpponent` internally calls the same `makeMove()` and `useGameRealtime()` functions
- Backend sees **identical API requests** as before
- Local games don't use backend anyway (bot AI runs in browser)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before (OnlineGame.tsx)
await makeMove(gameId, from, to, 'q')

// After (UnifiedChessGame.tsx)
await opponent.sendMove({ from, to, promotion: 'q' })
  // Which internally still calls:
  // await makeMove(gameId, from, to, 'q')
```

The refactoring reorganizes **how the UI is structured**, not **what it sends to the server**.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Online Games
**Mitigation**:
- Phase 1 doesn't touch existing code
- Phase 2 creates new components in parallel
- Keep old code until Phase 4
- Extensive testing at each phase

### Risk 2: Bot AI Performance Issues
**Mitigation**:
- AI already works in offline game
- Just wrap it with `GameOpponent` interface
- Add artificial delay to prevent blocking UI
- Use Web Workers if needed (future optimization)

### Risk 3: Realtime Sync Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Keep existing Supabase integration
- `useSupabaseOpponent` is thin wrapper
- Opponent interface isolates complexity
- Fallback to existing code if issues

### Risk 4: Feature Parity Gaps
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive feature matrix (above)
- Prioritized P0/P1/P2 features
- Test checklist for each phase
- Keep old code as reference

## Why This Refactoring Matters

### The Problem We're Solving

**Current State** (Duplication + Confusion):
```
OnlineGame.tsx (450 lines)
├── Chess rules (chess.js)
├── Board state
├── Sound effects
├── UI rendering
├── Move validation
├── Network communication (Supabase)
└── All mixed together!

useMoveRules.ts (435 lines)
├── Chess rules (custom)
├── Board state
├── Sound effects
├── Move validation
├── Bot AI integration
└── All mixed together!

Result: Can't reuse anything, duplicate bugs, confusing responsibilities
```

**After Refactoring** (Clean + Reusable):
```
UnifiedChessGame (single component)
├── Chess rules (chess.js)
├── Board state
├── Sound effects
├── UI rendering
├── Move validation
└── Uses: opponent.sendMove() / opponent.onOpponentMove()
    │
    ├── Online: useSupabaseOpponent (network communication)
    ├── Bot: useLocalOpponent (AI calculation)
    └── Friend: useLocalOpponent (no-op)

Result: Write once, works everywhere, clear responsibilities
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth for Game Logic**
   - One place for chess rules
   - One place for sounds
   - One place for validation
   - Fix a bug once, fixed everywhere

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Game = "What happens in chess?"
   - Opponent = "How do I communicate with the other player?"
   - No more "where does this logic belong?"

3. **Easy to Add Features**
   - Want to add animations? Add to Game component, works for all modes
   - Want to add new bot difficulty? Just add new OpponentConfig
   - Want to add spectator mode? Just another opponent type!

4. **Better Testing**
   - Test Game component with mock opponent
   - Test Opponent implementations independently
   - Clear boundaries = easier to test

5. **Future Extensions**
   - Add puzzle mode: Same Game component, puzzle opponent
   - Add analysis mode: Same Game component, no opponent
   - Add online bot challenges: Combine online + bot opponent
   - Add replay mode: Same Game component, replay opponent

### What Makes This Different from Other Refactorings

Most refactorings just move code around. **This refactoring clarifies concepts.**

Before: "Is the opponent part of the game?"
After: "No! The opponent is WHO you're playing. The game is WHAT you're playing."

This mental model makes everything clearer:
- Game rules don't change based on opponent
- Sounds don't change based on opponent
- Board doesn't change based on opponent
- Only communication channel changes!

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Opponent abstraction created
2. ✅ **Phase 2 Complete** - ChessGame component fully implemented
3. **Phase 2.5 - Integration & Testing** (CURRENT - IN PROGRESS)

   **Immediate Next Steps:**

   a. **Add Timer Sync for Online Mode** (CRITICAL)
      - Extract timer countdown logic from OnlineGame.tsx (lines 65-140)
      - Decision: Where to put timer sync?
        - Option A: Inside ChessGame component (useEffect for online)
        - Option B: Extend useSupabaseOpponent to manage timers
        - Option C: Create separate useOnlineTimer hook
      - Handle timeout → update database → declare winner

   b. **Create Test Page** (to verify ChessGame works)
      - Create simple test route or page
      - Instantiate ChessGame with different opponents
      - Start with offline modes (easier to test)

   c. **Test Offline Modes First**
      - Bot mode (easy/medium/hard)
      - Friend mode (local multiplayer)
      - Verify all features work

   d. **Then Test Online Mode**
      - Test with real Supabase opponent
      - Verify move sync and timer sync
      - Test edge cases

4. **Phase 3** - Polish & edge cases (undo/hints already done)
5. **Phase 4** - Replace old components and cleanup

**Estimated Remaining Time**: 4-6 hours (Phases 2.5, 3-4)

**Critical Decision Needed**: Where should online timer sync logic live?
- If in ChessGame: Keeps all game logic centralized
- If in useSupabaseOpponent: Better separation, opponent owns timing
- If in separate hook: Most modular, but adds complexity

**Benefits Already Achieved**:
- ✅ Clear separation of Game vs Opponent
- ✅ Simple, focused interface (3 methods)
- ✅ Both opponent types working
- ✅ Zero existing code broken

**Benefits After Completion**:
- 50% less code duplication
- Easier to add new features
- Consistent UX across all modes
- Better testability
- Future-proof architecture
