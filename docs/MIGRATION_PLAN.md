# Unified Chess Game Architecture - Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Migrate to a unified architecture where both online and offline games use the same core components, with the online game's realtime approach as the foundation.

**Strategy**: Phased migration with the local game kept as reference until all features are migrated.

**Timeline**: 4 phases, incrementally building features while maintaining stability.

### The Core Principle: Separation of Concerns

**Game ≠ Opponent**

This refactoring is fundamentally about separating two distinct responsibilities:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         GAME COMPONENT          │
│                                 │
│  Owns EVERYTHING about the game:│
│  • Chess rules (chess.js)       │
│  • Board state                  │
│  • Sound effects                │
│  • UI rendering                 │
│  • Move validation              │
│  • Game end detection           │
│  • Captured pieces              │
│  • Move history                 │
│  • Timers                       │
└────────────┬────────────────────┘
             │
             │ uses
             │
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      OPPONENT ABSTRACTION       │
│                                 │
│  ONLY handles communication:    │
│  • sendMove(from, to)           │
│  • onOpponentMove(callback)     │
│  • That's it!                   │
│                                 │
│  NO game logic                  │
│  NO board state                 │
│  NO validation                  │
│  NO sounds                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Matters:**

Before this refactoring, responsibilities were confused:
- ❌ Opponent was handling game state
- ❌ Opponent was triggering sounds
- ❌ Opponent was managing game completion
- ❌ Game logic was spread across game and opponent

After this refactoring, responsibilities are clear:
- ✅ Game owns ALL game logic
- ✅ Opponent ONLY passes messages
- ✅ Clean separation = easier to reason about
- ✅ Either opponent type (online/bot/friend) works the same way

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Online Game (Target Architecture)
**File**: `src/components/OnlineGame.tsx`

**Purpose**: Human vs Human over the network

#### ✅ What It Has:
- **Realtime sync** via Supabase channels
- **Optimistic updates** for responsive UX
- **Server validation** with rollback on rejection
- **Better piece selection UX** (click to deselect, switch pieces)
- **chess.js library** for rules (industry standard)
- **Timer management** with timeout handling
- **Forfeit functionality**

#### ❌ Needs to Add:
- ❌ Drag and drop pieces
- ❌ Promotion modal (currently hardcoded to queen)
- ❌ Checkmate sound (currently plays check sound)
- ❌ Better stalemate handling

#### 🚫 Intentionally Excluded (by design):
- 🚫 Undo moves - Can't undo opponent's moves
- 🚫 Hints - Unfair competitive advantage
- 🚫 Game reset - Games persist in database
- 🚫 Game mode selection - Mode is "online multiplayer"
- 🚫 Bot/AI opponent - Uses human opponents

---

### Offline Game (Reference Implementation)
**Files**: `src/hooks/useMoveRules.ts`, `src/hooks/useGameBoard.ts`, `src/hooks/useComputerAI.ts`

**Purpose**: Human vs Bot or Human vs Human (local)

#### ✅ What It Has:
- **Drag and drop** fully implemented
- **Undo moves** with full game state reconstruction
- **Hints system** (unlimited, shows best moves)
- **Game reset** with mode selection
- **Promotion modal** (choose piece type)
- **Bot AI** with difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- **Game mode** (vs Friend, vs Bot)
- **Complete game state management** (en passant, castling, etc.)
- **Checkmate sound** properly plays

#### ❌ Needs to Add:
- ❌ Better piece selection UX (from online game)

#### 🚫 Intentionally Excluded (by design):
- 🚫 Network/online features - Local only
- 🚫 Forfeit - Can just reset the game

---

## Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Online | Offline | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| Click to move | ✅ Advanced | ✅ Basic | - | Online has better UX |
| Drag and drop | ❌ | ✅ | **P0** | Needed for offline |
| Valid move highlights | ✅ | ✅ | - | Both have |
| Undo moves | N/A | ✅ | **P1** | **Offline only** - Can't undo opponent |
| Hints | N/A | ✅ | **P1** | **Offline only** - Would be unfair online |
| Game reset | ❌ | ✅ | **P2** | Needed for offline |
| Promotion modal | ❌ | ✅ | **P0** | Both need this |
| Sound effects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Unified |
| Move history | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Both have |
| Captured pieces | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Both have |
| Timers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done | Both have |
| Bot AI | N/A | ✅ | **P0** | **Offline only** - Local opponent |
| Online multiplayer | ✅ | N/A | ✅ Done | **Online only** - Network opponent |
| Forfeit | ✅ | N/A | ✅ Done | **Online only** - Can just reset offline |
| Checkmate sound | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ | **P2** | Polish |
| Stalemate detection | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ | **P2** | Polish |

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Feature exists
- ❌ = Feature missing (needs to be added)
- **N/A** = Feature not applicable to this mode (by design)
- ⚠️ = Feature partially implemented

---

## Phased Migration Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current State)
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- [x] Sound effects unified via `useChessSounds` hook
- [x] Both games working independently
- [x] Online game has better piece selection UX

---

### Phase 1: Create Abstraction Layer ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Build the opponent abstraction focused ONLY on communication

**Duration**: Completed

**Key Learning**: Opponent should NOT handle game logic - only message passing!

#### What We Built:

1. **`types/gameOpponent.ts`** - Super simple interface
   ```typescript
   interface OpponentMove {
     from: string        // Just "e2"
     to: string          // Just "e4"
     promotion?: string  // Just "q"
     // NO FEN, NO board state, NO game data!
   }

   interface GameOpponent {
     // Send my move to opponent
     sendMove: (move: OpponentMove) => Promise<void>

     // Listen for opponent's move
     onOpponentMove: (callback: (move: OpponentMove) => void) => () => void

     // Cleanup
     disconnect: () => void

     // UI flag (show forfeit vs undo/hints)
     isOnline: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **`hooks/useSupabaseOpponent.ts`** - Online communication
   - Sends move to server via `makeMove()`
   - Broadcasts move via realtime channel
   - Receives opponent's move from channel
   - **Does NOT**: Validate, update board, play sounds, manage game state

3. **`hooks/useLocalOpponent.ts`** - Local communication
   - Bot mode: Triggers AI calculation (easy/medium/hard)
   - Friend mode: No-op (both players local)
   - Artificial delay (200-500ms) for natural feel
   - **Does NOT**: Apply moves, validate, update board, play sounds

**Key Principle Established**:
```
Game Component:
├── Owns: Rules, board, sounds, UI, validation, timers
└── Uses: opponent.sendMove() and opponent.onOpponentMove()

Opponent Hook:
├── Owns: Message passing ONLY
└── Does NOT: Touch game state, sounds, validation, board
```

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Clean `GameOpponent` interface (communication only)
- ✅ `useSupabaseOpponent` (thin wrapper around existing Supabase calls)
- ✅ `useLocalOpponent` (bot AI + artificial delay)
- ✅ Zero existing code modified
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

---

### Phase 2: Unified Game Component (Core Features)
**Goal**: Create new unified game component with essential features

**Duration**: 3-4 hours

#### Tasks:

1. **Create `components/UnifiedChessGame.tsx`**
   - Single game component that works for both online and offline
   - Uses `GameOpponent` interface
   - Implements core chess gameplay

2. **Migrate Core Features First**:
   - ✅ Board rendering
   - ✅ Click to move (advanced UX from online)
   - ✅ Valid move highlights
   - ✅ Sound effects (already unified)
   - ✅ Move history
   - ✅ Captured pieces
   - ✅ Timers

3. **Add P0 Features** (blocking for feature parity):
   - **Drag and drop** from offline game
   - **Promotion modal** from offline game
   - **Bot AI opponent** via `useLocalOpponent`

4. **Create `pages/UnifiedGame.tsx`**
   - Router logic to determine opponent type
   - Pass appropriate `GameOpponent` implementation

5. **Test with both opponent types**:
   - Online multiplayer works
   - Local vs Bot works
   - Local vs Friend works

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `UnifiedChessGame` component working
- ✅ Drag and drop functional
- ✅ Promotion modal working
- ✅ Bot AI integrated
- ✅ All P0 features complete

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (P1)
**Goal**: Add quality-of-life features

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

#### Tasks:

1. **Undo System**
   - Works for offline games only (can't undo opponent's moves)
   - Disable in online games or implement "takeback request" flow
   - Reuse logic from `useMoveRules.handleUndo`

2. **Hints System**
   - Works for offline games only
   - Show best move suggestions
   - Reuse logic from `useMoveRules.handleHint`
   - Uses `getBestMoves` from chess utilities

3. **Game Mode Selection**
   - Modal at game start for offline games
   - Choose: vs Friend, vs Easy Bot, vs Medium Bot, vs Hard Bot

4. **Improved Sound Logic**
   - Add checkmate sound properly
   - Ensure consistent timing between online/offline

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Undo working for offline games
- ✅ Hints system functional
- ✅ Game mode selection working
- ✅ Sound effects consistent

---

### Phase 4: Polish & Cleanup (P2)
**Goal**: Remove old code, add final touches

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Tasks:

1. **Migration Complete**:
   - Route all games through `UnifiedChessGame`
   - Remove old `OnlineGame.tsx` component
   - Remove old `useMoveRules.ts` hook
   - Keep utility functions in `utils/chess.ts`

2. **Game Reset**
   - Allow resetting/starting new game
   - Keep game mode selection modal

3. **Final Features**:
   - Stalemate detection and modal
   - Draw by repetition detection
   - Insufficient material detection

4. **Testing**:
   - Test all game modes thoroughly
   - Test online multiplayer end-to-end
   - Test bot AI at all difficulty levels
   - Test edge cases (checkmate, stalemate, promotion, castling, en passant)

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with new architecture
   - Document the `GameOpponent` interface
   - Add comments to key functions

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Old code removed
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ Comprehensive testing complete
- ✅ Documentation updated

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Keep chess.js for Online Games?
- Industry-standard library
- Server-side validation already uses it
- More reliable than custom implementation
- Online games need server trust anyway

### 2. Why Add Artificial Latency to Local Games?
- Consistent UX between online and offline
- Prevents jarring instant bot moves
- Makes animations and sounds feel natural
- Configurable (can be disabled for debugging)

### 3. Why Are Undo/Hints/Bot AI Offline-Only?

**These features are NOT applicable to online games by design:**

**Undo:**
- You can't undo your opponent's moves
- Online games are competitive - no take-backs
- Could add "takeback request" feature later (mutual agreement)
- Offline games allow undo because you control both sides

**Hints:**
- Would be unfair advantage in competitive online play
- Like having a coach whispering moves during a tournament
- Offline games allow hints for learning/practice

**Bot AI:**
- Online games have human opponents via network
- Bot AI is the "opponent" for offline games
- Two completely different opponent types (network vs local)
- This is the core reason for the `GameOpponent` abstraction!

### 4. How to Handle Different Timer Behaviors?
- Online: Server-synced timers (authoritative)
- Offline: Local timers (no sync needed)
- Both use same `Timer` component
- Opponent interface abstracts the difference

### 5. Do We Need Backend/Service Changes?

**NO! This is a frontend-only refactoring.**

**What stays the same:**
- ✅ Database schema (games, moves, profiles tables)
- ✅ `validate-move` edge function
- ✅ Supabase Realtime channels
- ✅ Authentication & RLS policies
- ✅ All API contracts

**Why no backend changes needed:**
- The `GameOpponent` interface is a **thin wrapper** around existing Supabase calls
- `useSupabaseOpponent` internally calls the same `makeMove()` and `useGameRealtime()` functions
- Backend sees **identical API requests** as before
- Local games don't use backend anyway (bot AI runs in browser)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before (OnlineGame.tsx)
await makeMove(gameId, from, to, 'q')

// After (UnifiedChessGame.tsx)
await opponent.sendMove({ from, to, promotion: 'q' })
  // Which internally still calls:
  // await makeMove(gameId, from, to, 'q')
```

The refactoring reorganizes **how the UI is structured**, not **what it sends to the server**.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Online Games
**Mitigation**:
- Phase 1 doesn't touch existing code
- Phase 2 creates new components in parallel
- Keep old code until Phase 4
- Extensive testing at each phase

### Risk 2: Bot AI Performance Issues
**Mitigation**:
- AI already works in offline game
- Just wrap it with `GameOpponent` interface
- Add artificial delay to prevent blocking UI
- Use Web Workers if needed (future optimization)

### Risk 3: Realtime Sync Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Keep existing Supabase integration
- `useSupabaseOpponent` is thin wrapper
- Opponent interface isolates complexity
- Fallback to existing code if issues

### Risk 4: Feature Parity Gaps
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive feature matrix (above)
- Prioritized P0/P1/P2 features
- Test checklist for each phase
- Keep old code as reference

## Why This Refactoring Matters

### The Problem We're Solving

**Current State** (Duplication + Confusion):
```
OnlineGame.tsx (450 lines)
├── Chess rules (chess.js)
├── Board state
├── Sound effects
├── UI rendering
├── Move validation
├── Network communication (Supabase)
└── All mixed together!

useMoveRules.ts (435 lines)
├── Chess rules (custom)
├── Board state
├── Sound effects
├── Move validation
├── Bot AI integration
└── All mixed together!

Result: Can't reuse anything, duplicate bugs, confusing responsibilities
```

**After Refactoring** (Clean + Reusable):
```
UnifiedChessGame (single component)
├── Chess rules (chess.js)
├── Board state
├── Sound effects
├── UI rendering
├── Move validation
└── Uses: opponent.sendMove() / opponent.onOpponentMove()
    │
    ├── Online: useSupabaseOpponent (network communication)
    ├── Bot: useLocalOpponent (AI calculation)
    └── Friend: useLocalOpponent (no-op)

Result: Write once, works everywhere, clear responsibilities
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth for Game Logic**
   - One place for chess rules
   - One place for sounds
   - One place for validation
   - Fix a bug once, fixed everywhere

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Game = "What happens in chess?"
   - Opponent = "How do I communicate with the other player?"
   - No more "where does this logic belong?"

3. **Easy to Add Features**
   - Want to add animations? Add to Game component, works for all modes
   - Want to add new bot difficulty? Just add new OpponentConfig
   - Want to add spectator mode? Just another opponent type!

4. **Better Testing**
   - Test Game component with mock opponent
   - Test Opponent implementations independently
   - Clear boundaries = easier to test

5. **Future Extensions**
   - Add puzzle mode: Same Game component, puzzle opponent
   - Add analysis mode: Same Game component, no opponent
   - Add online bot challenges: Combine online + bot opponent
   - Add replay mode: Same Game component, replay opponent

### What Makes This Different from Other Refactorings

Most refactorings just move code around. **This refactoring clarifies concepts.**

Before: "Is the opponent part of the game?"
After: "No! The opponent is WHO you're playing. The game is WHAT you're playing."

This mental model makes everything clearer:
- Game rules don't change based on opponent
- Sounds don't change based on opponent
- Board doesn't change based on opponent
- Only communication channel changes!

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Opponent abstraction created
2. **Phase 2 Next** - Create UnifiedChessGame component
3. **Incremental commits** - Small, testable changes
4. **Continuous testing** - Verify no regressions
5. **Documentation** - Update as we go

**Estimated Remaining Time**: 6-9 hours (Phases 2-4)

**Benefits Already Achieved**:
- ✅ Clear separation of Game vs Opponent
- ✅ Simple, focused interface (3 methods)
- ✅ Both opponent types working
- ✅ Zero existing code broken

**Benefits After Completion**:
- 50% less code duplication
- Easier to add new features
- Consistent UX across all modes
