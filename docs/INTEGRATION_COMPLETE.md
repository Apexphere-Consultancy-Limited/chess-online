# Online Multiplayer Integration - Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated online multiplayer functionality according to the MVP Implementation Spec. The application now supports both local gameplay (vs Friend, vs AI) and online multiplayer games.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Integration (Supabase Edge Functions)

✅ **API Documentation Created:**
- [create-game.md](APIs/create-game.md) - Create new online chess games
- [validate-move.md](APIs/validate-move.md) - Validate and execute chess moves

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### **New Files Created:**

1. **[src/hooks/useGameRealtime.ts](../src/hooks/useGameRealtime.ts)**
   - Real-time game updates using Supabase Realtime
   - Subscribes to move insertions for live gameplay
   - Matches spec lines 869-902

2. **[src/hooks/useMakeMove.ts](../src/hooks/useMakeMove.ts)**
   - Calls `validate-move` Edge Function
   - Handles authentication and error states
   - Matches spec lines 906-944

3. **[src/hooks/useCreateGame.ts](../src/hooks/useCreateGame.ts)**
   - Calls `create-game` Edge Function
   - Creates games with random color assignment
   - Matches spec lines 948-981

4. **[src/components/OnlineGame.tsx](../src/components/OnlineGame.tsx)**
   - Dedicated component for online multiplayer
   - Uses chess.js for local validation
   - Integrates with Supabase for server validation
   - Real-time move synchronization

#### **Files Updated:**

1. **[src/lib/supabaseClient.ts](../src/lib/supabaseClient.ts:16-58)**
   - Added TypeScript types: `Profile`, `Game`, `Move`
   - Matches spec lines 714-766

2. **[src/App.tsx](../src/App.tsx:16)**
   - Added dynamic route: `/game/:gameId`
   - Supports both local and online game modes

3. **[src/pages/Game.tsx](../src/pages/Game.tsx:15-20)**
   - Routes between local and online modes based on `gameId` param
   - Preserves existing local gameplay functionality

4. **[src/pages/Home.tsx](../src/pages/Home.tsx:267-350)**
   - Added "Challenge Opponent" section
   - Form to create games by username
   - Only visible to authenticated users

### 3. Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install chess.js
```

## How It Works

### Creating an Online Game

1. User logs in to the application
2. Navigates to home page and sees "Challenge Opponent" section
3. Enters opponent's username
4. System calls `create-game` Edge Function
5. Colors are randomly assigned
6. User is redirected to `/game/{gameId}`

### Playing an Online Game

1. Player navigates to `/game/{gameId}`
2. `OnlineGame` component loads game state from Supabase
3. Player sees their color and current turn status
4. When it's their turn, they can make moves:
   - Click on a piece to select it
   - Click on a valid square to move
   - Move is sent to `validate-move` Edge Function
   - Server validates, updates database, and broadcasts to opponent
5. Real-time updates via `useGameRealtime` hook
6. Game continues until checkmate, stalemate, or draw

### Local vs Online Gameplay

- **`/game`** - Local gameplay (vs Friend, vs AI)
  - Uses existing game engine
  - No server communication
  - Full offline support

- **`/game/:gameId`** - Online multiplayer
  - Server-validated moves
  - Real-time synchronization
  - Requires authentication

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation follows **Stage 1: Supabase-only MVP** from [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md):

- ✅ Edge Functions for game logic
- ✅ Supabase Realtime for updates
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Client-side React with TypeScript
- ✅ No custom backend server needed

## Testing Checklist

To test the online multiplayer:

1. **Create two user accounts:**
   - Sign up as `player1@test.com` (username: player1)
   - Sign up as `player2@test.com` (username: player2)

2. **Create a game:**
   - Sign in as player1
   - On home page, enter "player2" in challenge form
   - Click "Create Game"

3. **Join the game:**
   - Open incognito/different browser
   - Sign in as player2
   - Navigate to the game URL shown to player1

4. **Play the game:**
   - Players alternate making moves
   - Verify moves sync in real-time
   - Test invalid moves (should be rejected)
   - Play until checkmate/stalemate

5. **Verify game completion:**
   - Check game status updates to "completed"
   - Check that result is displayed correctly

## Next Steps

For production deployment:

1. Deploy Edge Functions to Supabase (if not already deployed)
2. Set environment variables in hosting platform
3. Enable Realtime on the `moves` table in Supabase dashboard
4. Test with multiple users in production environment
