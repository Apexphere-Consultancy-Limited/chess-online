## Requests

### POST / PATCH

```json
{
  "status": "available",
  "lobbySlug": "main"
}
```

**Fields**
- `status` (string, optional) — `"available"` or `"in_game"`. Defaults to `"available"`.
- `lobbySlug` (string, optional) — Target lobby to join. If omitted, backend auto-selects a lobby based on the player’s ELO.

```

### Error Payloads

- **400 Bad Request** – Invalid status value or invalid lobby slug.
- **401 Unauthorized** – Missing/invalid JWT.
- **403 Forbidden** – Attempted to join a private lobby without membership.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Unexpected failure during upsert.

## Notes

- Auto-placement uses ELO bands seeded in the `lobbies` table (Starter/Main/Advanced).
- `status` is updated on heartbeat calls; clients should POST or PATCH every ~20 seconds while online.
- Deleting the session is recommended when leaving the lobby view or after a challenge is accepted.
